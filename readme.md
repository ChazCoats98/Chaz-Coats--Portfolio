# Portfolio
## Description
This is it! my portfolio. I wanted to make a somewhat unique way to display my work as well as my resume. As we all know, its a challenge to describe yourself in words. For this reason, I aimed to demonstrate my skills rather than just write them.
## Future Improvements 
There are a few things that could use some polishing and detail work. I also plan on cleaning up the code a bit. Some code is not used, some code isn't structured the way I want. I decided to leave it here for now as I want to work on projects to add to it and I plan on applying to jobs soon.
