This website is a portfolio for all my programming work. 
The goal is to display my work in a clean, organized, and visually pleasing way. 
I used everyhing I learned using CSS and HTML to create this page. 
I had difficulty with responsive design and i dont feel like the look is where i want it to be. I plan to work on it a bit more and resubmit.
